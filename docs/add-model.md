# How to Add a Model Provider

This guide walks through adding a provider (using DeepSeek as an example) via the VS Code **Language Models** panel — the native, recommended approach.

---

## Step 1 — Open the model selector in Copilot Chat

Click the model selector at the bottom of the Copilot Chat input. You'll see the currently available models. DeepSeek and MiniMax are not listed yet.

## Step 2 — Open the Language Models panel and click "+ Add Models..."

Open the **Language Models** panel (`Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+P` → *Language Models*), then click **+ Add Models...** in the top-right corner. A dropdown lists all available providers. Select **DeepSeek** (or **MiniMax**).

## Step 3 — Confirm the group name

A prompt asks for a group name. The default is the provider name, but you can enter any name you like — as long as it doesn't conflict with an existing group. Press **Enter** to confirm.

## Step 4 — Enter your API key

Enter your API key (starts with `sk-`) and press **Enter**. The key is stored in VS Code's Secret Storage immediately — it is never written to disk or settings files.

Get your key from:
- DeepSeek: [platform.deepseek.com/api_keys](https://platform.deepseek.com/api_keys)
- MiniMax: [minimax.io — Interface Key](https://www.minimax.io/platform/user-center/basic-information/interface-key)

## Step 5 — Provider appears in the Language Models panel

The Language Models panel now shows the DeepSeek group with both models listed. Click the ⚙ icon next to the group name to change the API key or adjust settings at any time.

## Step 6 — Models are available in Copilot Chat

Open the model selector in Copilot Chat again. DeepSeek V4 Flash and DeepSeek V4 Pro now appear under **Other Models**. Select one to start chatting.
